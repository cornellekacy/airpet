									<p>Just a quick note to you to tell you how much we appreciate Ted’s help on two recent shipments to Chicago. We had a supplier who made a mess of their SID# filing, and this caused a good deal of concern with the local FDA office.  As we got the situation resolved, the case was transferred to a very challenging FDA officer in the local compliance division.</p>
